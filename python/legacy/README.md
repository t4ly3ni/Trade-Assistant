# Legacy Scripts

These are the original standalone scripts that were used during early development.  
They have been superseded by the modular `bvmt/` package but are kept for reference.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `scraper.py` | Standalone CSV market data scraper (pandas) |
| `analyze.py` | Standalone CSV top hausse/baisse analyzer |
| `anomaly_detector.py` | Monolithic anomaly detector with console UI, sound alerts, CSV logging |

> **Do not use these files.** Use the `bvmt` package instead.
